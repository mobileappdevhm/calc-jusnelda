Assignment 1 - Create a Calculator App
========================================

### Introduction  
I created this App using a step-by-step Youtube tutorial, because this was my first time creating an App. The tutorial was really good as it used the newest versions of Xcode and Swift.  

### Learnings and Experiences 
While creating this App I learned a lot:  
* What an iOS App mainly consists of   
    * The `Main.storyboard` which is basically the designing part of the app where one can add **buttons** and **labels** and things like that. This is also the **front end** developing part.  
    * The `ViewController.swift` is the part that connects the front end with the actual logic behind it. I put the code for the calculator all in here, but I'm sure if the app gets bigger and more powerful the code should go into various files/classes from here.  
* How to use Xcode  
Opening Xcode for the first time is quite overwhelming and I'm glad I had a tutorial to get me accustomed with it. I only know the most basic things about it now and I was able to create a simple app which is nice.  
* How to design an App fast and easy  
The tutorial showed that there are several ways to make it really fast and easy to design the app using **stacks** and **constraints**. With these features you can align all the buttons correctly and never have to worry about accidentally changing an element of the app.  
* Got an insight on Swift  
I have a little understanding now on how **Swift** works, but it's not nearly enough yet to say that I *know* the language. I though it was a bit like a stripped down version of `C/C++`.  
* How difficult crossplattform developement might be, if _cross-iPhone_ is already pretty hard  
In Xcode you have the opportunity to look at your app on other iOS devices and eventhough those are *almost* all the same, the app looked a bit different everytime.  So I can only imagine how difficult it might be to develop a cross-plattform app that is actually pretty and usable(!) on all devices.  
* That you need to have an Apple developer account to be able to deploy your iOS app to your device  
I wasn't aware that you actually need to have an Apple developer account to be able to deploy your own app to your device. I would have liked to see my calculator app on my iPhone.

Other experiences  I made were:  
* The versions of Xcode really make a difference  
I noticed that the versions of Xcode differ quite a bit. The first tutorial I tried, I couldn't finish, because nearly every action was different in my version of Xcode.  
* Tutorials are nice, but if you want to develop an app by yourself you need a good plan and strategy  
If you follow a step-by-step guide , it's easy to make the right steps at the right time. I noticed that if you want to change something in the front end if the backend is already implemented it's not so easy and you might break something. So before I start creating a new app from scratch, I'll think about the front end a bit longer and only start the back end if I'm sure what I'm doing.  


### Technical Details about the app
The video to the tutorial can be found here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoS9dsdcgLA>

To develop I used: 
* MacBook Air (11 inch, Mid 2013)  
* macOS High Sierra 10.13.3  
* Xcode 9.2  
* Apple Swift version 4.0.3 (swiftlang-900.0.74.1 clang-900.0.39.2)

*The colors I chose are those of the Formula Student Team of the Hochschule Muenchen municHMotorsport which I am a member of.*
